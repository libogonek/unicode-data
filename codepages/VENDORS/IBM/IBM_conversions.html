IBM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONVERSION&nbsp; MAPPING &nbsp; TABLES<br>
<br>
IBM&nbsp; has a repository of character data mapping tables between
many different character encodings and Unicode.&nbsp; The mapping of
some characters in the IBM conversion tables may vary from those of
other vendors.&nbsp; These differences may be due to differences in
interpretation of international or country standards.&nbsp; They may
also be due to historical product or platform preferences.&nbsp; IBM
conversion&nbsp; tables are available from a number of sources.&nbsp;
Unicode mappings can be found in&nbsp; the <a
 href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/index.jsp">International
Components for Unicode (ICU)</a> which is a mature, portable set
of C/C++ and Java libraries for Unicode support, software
internationalization (I18N) and globalization (G11N), giving
applications the same results on all platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, IBM has the <a
 href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/globalization/cdra/index.jsp">Character
Data Representation Architecture (CDRA)</a> which defines a set of
identifiers and supporting resources for data identification and
conversion.&nbsp; The CDRA conversion table resources can be obtained
from <a
 href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/downloads.jsp">IBM
developerWorks</a>. The tables are found in the <b>Downloads &amp;
products</b> view, under the heading Character Data Conversion
Tables.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should you require additional information on any
IBM conversion mapping tables please contact <span
