The POSIX data contained in this directory contains locale source files that
can be used as the basis for a POSIX locale implementation using CLDR data.
The directory provides UTF-8 locale sources ( BMP characters only ) for all
locales supported by CLDR.   Individual operating systems provide certain
extensions to the POSIX requirements, some of which are supported by the
tools ( Solaris, AIX ).  In most cases, the data here is a good starting
point for a POSIX locale implementation, but may need to be modified 
depending in platform considerations.  The tools also support generation
of locale sources for character sets other than UTF-8.  

Refer to the tools in tools/java/org/unicode/cldr/posix for more
information.
